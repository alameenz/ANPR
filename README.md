Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using EasyOCR, focuses on developing a system to enhance traffic management and compliance monitoring. The system detects vehicle number plates in real-time using advanced computer vision techniques and extracts alphanumeric details through the EasyOCR library. These details are cross-referenced with government databases to retrieve owner and vehicle information, including pending challans, pollution certificate status, and insurance validity. Additionally, the system automates notifications for violations or expirations by sending alerts to vehicle owners, ensuring timely fine payments and renewals. This project aims to streamline enforcement and promote road safety through efficient and automated processes.
